# mediSCAPE_stitching
FIJI macro for pairwise stitching mediSCAPE volumes acquired during a roving scan.

For continuous stitching of roving SCAPE scans when canvasing a large region of tissue as demonstrated in Patel et al. (2021)

This requires:
 - .tiff stacks for each color and timepoint
 + optional: flatfield correction matrices for the data (here "gradC#.tiff" - needs to be opened upon running script)
